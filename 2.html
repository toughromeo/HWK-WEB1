    CSS Industries began as City Stores Company, a holding company for established department stores in urban centers. A phenomenon of the 1920s, such “ownership groups” took advantage of the various cost efficiencies accrued from volume purchases of merchandise for resale, benefits reaped by retail chains and cooperative buying groups. The stores within an ownership group operated separately, however, maintaining their original trade names and identities.
